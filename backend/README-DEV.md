# Backend developer notes

Run these commands from the `backend/` folder:

Install dev and prod dependencies:

```powershell
npm ci
```

Run the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Lint and format:

```powershell
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Run tests:

```powershell
npm test
```

Notes:
- We added ESLint and Prettier configs. Install dependencies before running lint/format.
- We added a logger (`logger.js`) using `pino`.
- We added a basic GitHub Actions workflow and Dependabot config.
- In production ensure `SESSION_SECRET` is set to a strong value.
 - On Windows PowerShell, you may need to allow script execution for npm: run PowerShell as Administrator and execute `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`. Revert if desired after install.
 - Puppeteer 21.3.8 is used. In production (e.g., Render), set these envs to use a cached browser:
	 - `PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR=/opt/render/.cache/puppeteer`
	 - `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/opt/render/.cache/puppeteer/chrome/linux-140.0.7339.207/chrome-linux64/chrome`
	 The server will prefer `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`; locally Puppeteerâ€™s bundled Chromium or your system Chrome/Edge will be used.
